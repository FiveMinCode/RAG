Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses. This method helps improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

The RAG approach consists of two main steps:
1. **Retrieval:** The system searches a database or a set of documents to find relevant context based on the userâ€™s query.
2. **Generation:** The retrieved information is combined with the original prompt, allowing the language model to generate informed responses.

Advantages of RAG:
- Reduces misinformation by grounding responses in retrieved data.
- Can be customized with domain-specific knowledge.
- Supports dynamic updates without retraining the model.

Example use cases:
- Customer support with knowledge base integration.
- Medical AI applications retrieving latest research papers.
- Legal AI systems retrieving case law.

In summary, RAG improves the reliability of AI-generated responses by incorporating relevant retrieved context.
